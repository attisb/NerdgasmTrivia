			<h4>Hire Nerdgasm</h4>
			<p>Hiring us is about as simple as choosing Charmander as your first Pok√©mon. We want to bring a community to your event, bar, restaurant, even coffee shop that may not know you exist. I mean how loyal are nerds? Star Wars came out in 77 and people still cosplay Darth Vader.  It's all about bringing subjects even the closet freak wants to find a community to be able to talk about it to. The trivia is simple, runs about a hour and 15 minutes, just about as long as it takes to speedrun your favorite game.</p>
			
			<h5>About Our Start</h5>
			<p>Player One Video Game Bar is where the alpha began! Starting back in February of 2015, Nerdgasm Trivia at Player One has had a loyal following since day one. With a average attendance of 60+ people weekly, it can be a loud event where people are having a good time just getting to hang out with their friends, or it can be quiet because we've stumped them on a subject they <em>thought</em> they knew.</p>
