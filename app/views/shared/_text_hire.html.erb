<h5>Hire Nerdgasm</h5>
<p>Hiring us is about as simple as choosing Charmander as your first Pok√©mon. We want to bring a community to your event, bar, restaurant, even coffee shop that may not know you exist. I mean how loyal are nerds? Star Wars came out in 77 and people still cosplay Darth Vader.  It's all about bringing subjects even the closet freak wants to find a community to be able to talk about it to. The trivia is simple, runs about a hour and 15 minutes, just about as long as it takes to speedrun your favorite game.</p>
