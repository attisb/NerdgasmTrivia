<h5>Team Rules</h5>
<p>Rules are simple. Imagine you're Jason, the red ranger. You had five other rangers with you, of when werrn't fighting with Tommy, let's go with only teams of 6. As nerds we love technology of all kinds but no phone/smart watch usage during the game or game over. You can talk to other teams, just know you're hurting yourself. Even though it shouldn't have to be rule but respect the venue.</p>
